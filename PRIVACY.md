# Privacy Policy

## 1. Data Sovereignty
Officore Pro Suite 2026 is designed as a local-first application. We believe that your data belongs to you. No document content, spreadsheet data, or personal files are ever uploaded to Officore servers.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect
* **No Personal Data:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or contact information.
* **No Telemetry:** We do not track how you use the application. No analytics or tracking scripts (like Google Analytics) are embedded in the software.
* **No Cookies:** The web-based components do not use tracking cookies.

## 3. License Activation Logic
The license verification process is purely mathematical.
* It checks the validity of a key using an offline-capable SHA-256 algorithm.
* No personal identifying information (PII) is transmitted during this check.

## 4. Third-Party Services
If this software is used to access third-party services (e.g., via the frame), those services may have their own privacy policies. Officore is not responsible for the data practices of external providers.

## 5. Security
We implement industry-standard cryptographic methods to ensure the integrity of the application and the security of the license validation process.
